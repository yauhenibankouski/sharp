TECHNIQUE = [
  'Start by standing in front of a barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart.
  Pick up the barbell while keeping your arms extended straight down.
  Stand up straight with the barbell in your hands, and refrain from moving your arms.
  Bend back down at the knees with barbell.',
  'Hold onto a barbell with your palms facing down. Bend your knees slightly and bend forward at the waist while keeping your back straight. It should be almost parallel with the floor. The barbell should be directly in front of you; your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This is the starting position.
  While keeping your torso stationary, lift the barbell toward you. Your elbows should be kept close to your body. Use only your forearms to hold the weight. When you get to the top, squeeze your back muscles and hold for a few seconds.
  Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
  Repeat the process for the number of repetitions in your workout routine.',
  'Extend your arms toward the ceiling, over your chest. Your palms should be facing each other and your elbows slightly bent.
  Inhale and extend the weights back and over your head, keeping a strong back and core.
  Take about 3 to 4 seconds to reach a fully extended position where the weights are behind—but not below—your head.
  Exhale slowly and return your arms to the starting position.',
  'Tighten your abs and firmly grasp the barbell with an overhand grip.
  Contract your traps to bring your shoulders up and slightly back at the same time.
  Slowly bring the barbell back to the starting position.',

  'Grip a barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. The bar should be directly over the shoulders.
  Press your feet firmly into the ground and keep your hips on the bench throughout the entire movement.
  Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine position throughout the movement.',
  'Lie with your head and shoulders supported by the bench and your feet flat on the floor.
  Hold the dumbbells directly above your chest, palms facing each other, then lower the weights in an arc out to the sides as far as is comfortable.
  Use your pectoral muscles to reverse the movement back to the start.
  Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout and don’t arch your back.',
  'Select the weight for the machine.
  Sit on the platform. Press your back firmly against the back of the platform with your feet flat on the floor.
  Grab one handle of the machine with each hand.
  Depending on the model, the pec deck may have a resting pad.
  If so, place your forearms on each pad. Bend your arms at a 90° angle and keep your elbows at chest level.
  Gripping the pec deck handles, pull your arms toward your body while contracting your pectoral muscles.
  Bring the handles or arm pads in front of your chest, hold the position for a couple of seconds, and then slowly release back to starting position.',
  'Grab the parallel bars and jump up, straighten your arms.
  Lower your body by bending your arms while leaning forward.
  Dip down until your shoulders are below your elbows.
  Lift your body up by straightening your arms.
  Lock your elbows at the top',

  'Start with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart.
  Keep your chest up, engage your abdominals, and shift your weight onto your heels as you push your hips back into a sitting position.
  Lower your hips until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel to the floor.
  You should feel the squat in your thighs and glutes.
  Pause with your knees over, but not beyond, your toes.
  Exhale and push back up to the starting position.',
  'Sit on a leg extension machine. Position your legs under the pad and grasp the side bars with your hands. This is the starting position.
  Extend your legs to the maximum, exhaling as you do so. Pause a second in this contracted position.
  Lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale. Make sure your legs don\'t go past the 90-degree angle point.
  Repeat for the desired number of reps.',
  'Lie face down on the leg curl machine, stretching your legs out fully.
  The roller pad should rest a few inches over your calves, just above the heels.
  Grasp the support handles on each side of the machine.
  Exhale and flex your knees, pulling your ankles as close to your buttocks as you can. Keep your hips firmly on the bench.
  Hold briefly.
  Inhale as you return your feet to the starting position in a slow and controlled movement.',
  'Sit down on a Leg Press Machine and press the plate up as if you were performing a leg press.
  Slide your feet down so that the balls of your feet are pressing against the rack (with your heels hanging free)
  Keeping the handles locked, press up and flex your toes and then slowly bring your toes back towards your body (dorsiflex).
  Perform these movements slowly for maximum benefit.'
